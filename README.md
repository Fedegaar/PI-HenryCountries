## Project's goals
In this individual project at Henry I had the opportunity to apply everything I learned in these 5 months. It should be noted that in it we were not allowed to use libraries, everything had to be "pure". The idea was to create a SPA (Single Page Application) that shows me relevant information from approximately 250 countries. I got them from an API that Henry provided me. Likewise, this information was stored in a database, and from there it was manipulated, to show it or add tourist activities to each country.

## Learnings
I remember that when I started the project all my knowledge was "up in the air", so I was able to finish settling it, uniting everything I had learned.
I was able to consolidate my knowledge in several technologies such us Promises, Async/Await, React, Redux.

## Conclusion
Actually at this point I was able to apply most of the technologies I learned. That's why I wasn't only learning, I also enjoyed it a lot! It was just the beginning of a long journey!

There are also pagination buttons, they will allow us to navigate between the pages and between the more than 200 countries. </p>
